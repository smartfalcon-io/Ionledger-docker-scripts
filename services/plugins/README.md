# Traction Aca-Py Plugins

Traction is a set of plugins that facilitate multi-tenant management within [Aca-Py](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python). Some of the plugins ([basicmessage_storage](./basicmessage_storage/README.md), [connection_update](./connection_update/README.md) and [multitenant_provider](./multitenant_provider/README.md)) can be used independently from Traction.
